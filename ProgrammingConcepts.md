# Shapes

There are 3 key elements to this game. Ball, bricks, and paddles.

I used rect() for bricks and paddle, and ellipse() for ball.

# Colors

For the sake of unity and visibility, I did not use constantly changing or colorful colors. 

I used the color() function only for ball and bricks.

# Variables

I created some variables for the asset, class, the game score and status.

*gameState* is my favorite variable, because it used for conditional statement and determines the status of the game and also use text() so that show itself to the player as a string.

# Conditional Statements

Used to enter the game state and keyboard input, determine colliding.

# Loops

I used nested loop to making arrays of bricks and show them.

# Functions

I created a few class functions. 

Show us the bricks, the ball and the paddle and update them, in particular the ball and brick have some functions for collision detection.

# Classes

I created 3 Classes, ball, bricks, and paddle.

# Arrays

I made arrays for bricks.
